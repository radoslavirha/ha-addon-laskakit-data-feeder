## New contributor guide

To get an overview of the project, read the [README](../README.md). Here are some resources to help you get started with open source contributions:

- [Finding ways to contribute to open source on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/finding-ways-to-contribute-to-open-source-on-github)
- [Set up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)
- [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)
- [Collaborating with pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests)

## Getting started

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with the docs, [search if an issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/radoslavirha/ha-addon-laskakit-data-feeder/issues/new/choose).

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/radoslavirha/ha-addon-laskakit-data-feeder/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters.

### Make Changes locally

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a working branch
3. See [the development guide](development.md).

### Commit your update

Adherence to [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) is required.

You can use GitHub issue ID in commit body prefixed with # (will be used in Changelog). E.g. #2

Full commit message:

```git
chore: use GitHub issue id in conventional commits

#2
```

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.

- Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

### Your PR is merged

Congratulations :tada::tada:
